                        <b>About Wheat</b>
                        <p>Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. The total area under the crop is about 29.8 million
                            hectares in the country. The production of wheat in the country has increased significantly
                            from
                            75.81 million MT in 2006-07 to an all time record high of 94.88 million MT in 2011-12. The
                            productivity of wheat which was 2602 kg/hectare in 2004-05 has increased to 3140 kg/hectare
                            in
                            2011-12. The major increase in the productivity of wheat has been observed in the states of
                            Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Higher area coverage is reported from MP in recent years.
                        </p>
                        <p>Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat
                            similar to U.S. hard white wheat. Wheat grown in central and western India is typically
                            hard, with high protein and high gluten content. India also produces around 1.0-1.2 million
                            tons of durum wheat, mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Most Indian durum is not
                            marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards. However, some
                            quantities are purchased by the private trade at a price premium, mainly for processing of
                            higher value/branded products.</p>
                        <p>The production and productivity of Wheat crop were quite low, when India became independent
                            in 1947. The production of Wheat was only 6.46 million tonnes and productivity was merely
                            663 kg per hectare during 1950-51, which was not sufficient to feed the Indian population.
                            The Country used to import Wheat in large quantities for fulfilling the needs of our people
                            from many countries like USA under PL-480. The reasons of low production and productivity of
                            Wheat at that time was (a) the tall growing plant habit resulting in lodging, when grown
                            under fertile soils, (b) the poor tillering and low sink capacity of the varieties used, (c)
                            higher susceptibility to diseases, (d) the higher sensitivity to thermo & photo variations,
                            etc., resulting in poor adaptability, and (e) longer crop duration resulting in a long
                            exposure of plants to the climatic variations and insect pest / disease attacks.</p>
                        <p>The Government of India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility of
                            increasing the crop productivity under prevailing Indian ecological conditions. As result of
                            various steps taken by Govt. of India, the Wheat scenario in our country has completely
                            changed. In the post Independence era, country used to import Wheat for our needs but due to
                            bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat in the 'Green Revolution' period
                            in late sixties, our country became self dependent in Wheat production. At present, country
                            is producing much more excess Wheat than the requirement and Godowns are over-flooded with
                            Wheat.</p>
                        <b>Indian Wheat Growing Zones</b>
                        <p>The entire wheat growing areas of the country has been categorized into 6 major zones as
                            follows</p>
                        <img src="wheat_growing_areas.png" class="rounded img-fluid mb-4" alt="Image Error">
                        <b>Climate Requirement</b>
                        <p>Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical
                            zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the
                            60 degree north altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with
                            the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be cultivated from sea level to as high as
                            3300 meters.</p>
                        <p>The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the major
                            portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen
                            properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C
                            though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 c. Rains just after sowing
                            hamper germination and encourage seedling blight. Areas with a warm and damp climate are not
                            suited for wheat growing.</p>
                        <p>During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are
                            harmful to wheat. Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures is conducive for
                            rust attack. Wheat plant requires about 14-15 c optimum average temperature at the time of
                            ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of grain filling and development are very
                            crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c during this period tend to depress grain weight.
                            When temperatures are high, too much energy I lost through the process of transpiration by
                            the plants and the reduced residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower
                            yields. Wheat is mainly a rabi (winter) season crop in India.</p>
                        <b>Soil</b>
                        <p>
                            Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good
                            structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should
                            be
                            taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained oils. Soil should be neutral in its
                            reaction.
                            Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These
                            soils absorb and retain rain water well. Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage
                            are
                            not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging. Wheat can be successfully grown on
                            lighter
                            soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.
                        </p>
                        <b>Fertilizer management</b>
                        <p>
                            The time and placement of fertilizer is another area where significant progress was made. It
                            was
                            demonstrated that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were
                            required
                            for optimum productivity. The N was to be applied in two split doses of 60 kg as basal and
                            the
                            remaining 60 kg at first irrigation and full phosphorus and potash to be applied as basal.
                            Recently, the new wheat varieties have responded up to 180 kg N/ha with optima dose around
                            150
                            kg/ha. In the Indo-Gangetic plains, application of zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat system was
                            found
                            to increase the yield substantially. Recently, the use of sulphur has been found beneficial
                            for
                            enhancing the productivity as well as the grain protein content of wheat. Response to Mn
                            (pockets in the Indo-Gangetic plains) and boron (eastern and far eastern region) has also
                            been
                            realized.</p>
                        <b>Nutrient management</b>
                        <p>
                            With intensive agriculture, deficiency of essential nutrients has also become wide spread.
                            The
                            work conducted under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Micronutrient in Crops
                            and
                            Soils, has shown wide spread deficiency of zinc in soils in India. At the national level,
                            the
                            deficiency level in micro nutrients is Zn: 46 %, B: 17 %, Mo: 12 %, Fe: 11 % and Cu: 5%. The
                            deficiency of sulphur has also been reported across a wide range of soils (38%).The yield
                            response to sulphur has been obtained in more than 40 crops including cereal, millets,
                            oilseeds
                            and pulses etc. To realize the potential yield, strategies may include
